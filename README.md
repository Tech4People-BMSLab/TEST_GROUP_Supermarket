# Repository Configuration
This repository is configured as a *template* repository. New repositories can easily created which inherit all contents.

# Project Purposes
This Unity project is a clean base that is used for the following purposes:
- base Unity project (starting point) for the individual groups of the "SKILLS: Persuasive environment" course (Mirjam Galetzka)
- base Unity project for research projects

# Project Usage
Usage of this project should be in the context of the purposes above, such as maintenance, bug fixes and feature additions.
Do not use this repository for individual research projects as this will bloat the project and defeat the purpose. Bloating is something we want to get rid of.
In a case like this you'd want to create a new repository and use this project as the template.

# Project Contents
Includes all contents relevant for the "SKILLS: Persuasive environment" course. Compared to older version this project uses the XR Toolkit exclusively (opposed to Oculus SDK).\
The environment has been refined in a couple of ways:
- Produce (fruits & veggies) are individually grabbable from the start. (Produce stacks/packs are removed as they cause problems and are not realistic for interaction
 
  
> [!WARNING]  
> The four different scenes for the PA study (Caroline Fischer) are currently not part of this repository.
